DynamicImage is a vertical drop-in solution for database based images, 
providing models, helper methods and a controller for retrieving images.

Thumbnails are generated on demand and stored in the cached_images.

== Requirements:

* Engines 1.2.0 (plugin)
* Rails 1.2.x
* RMagick (gem)
* Vector2d (gem)

== Installation:

Make sure you have all the requirements installed, then put the 
dynamic_image folder in vendor/plugins. 

DynamicImage uses three tables, <tt>images</tt>, <tt>cached_images</tt> 
and <tt>binaries</tt>. Please make sure these don't clash with your current
database schema. 

== Usage:

Use the <tt>dynamic_image_tag</tt> helper in your views to make urls from 
images, which wraps the <tt>dynamic_tag</tt> helper:

  <%= dynamic_image_tag @image, :size => '150x100' %>
